# wordpressplugins-grimage
Filters all images in content and wraps in a grimage span which launches the FB share onclick w/ THAT image loaded into the status window. Apply a class of "nogrimage" to the image you do not want this to occur on. Secondary CTA is launched on exit of the share dialog and displays a modal.

#To-do#
Set cookie so that the modal does not launch. [ 5/16/2016 ]
